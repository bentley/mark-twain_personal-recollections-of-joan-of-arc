			<h2 epub:type="title">A Peculiarity of Joan of Arc’s History</h2>
			<p>The details of the life of Joan of Arc form a biography which is unique among the world’s biographies in one respect: <em>It is the only story of a human life which comes to us under oath, the only one which comes to us from the witness-stand.</em> The official records of the Great Trial of 1431, and of the Process of Rehabilitation of a quarter of a century later, are still preserved in the National Archives of France, and they furnish with remarkable fullness the facts of her life. The history of no other life of that remote time is known with either the certainty or the comprehensiveness that attaches to hers.</p>
			<p>The Sieur Louis de Conte is faithful to her official history in his Personal Recollections, and thus far his trustworthiness is unimpeachable; but his mass of added particulars must depend for credit upon his word alone.</p>
